# Overview
Have you ever wanted to work at Starbucks? You're about to be one step closer. In this app inspired by Wordle, memorize coffee drink recipes and quiz yourself on a random real (and possibly discontinued üòâ) Starbucks drink's temperature, flavor, milk type, and blendedness. The app will let you know if you're a natural at barista-ing.

# Required Features
Quiz, quiz, quiz! In the required features for this project, you will have a form with multiple choice inputs that can be selected and their values will populate the answer box above them. Then when submitted, the answer boxes will turn red if the answers placed there are incorrect and purple if the answers are correct. Can you handle the Starbucks drink station at an 8 am rush?

# Stretch Features
In the stretch goals, we are making it a little harder by having users have to guess our four ingredients for each drink and type in their answer. Of course this means that they cannot just type in anything, their guesses still have to be in line with what options we have given for the 4 categories. How can we enforce that?

# üéØ Goals
By the end of this lab you will be able to...

[X] Create React forms from scratch and dynamically populating their answer choices
[X] Create a new custom component within a parent component and passing in props and ways to edit state variables
[X] Creating and using React forms
[X] Creating and setting state variables of all kinds
[X] Using state variables to edit information on a page 
[X] Importing data files into an app
[X] Using user input to change a visual aspect of the app

# Features
## Required Features
[X] One drink at a time is displayed

[X] The user can click one option for each of the four categories to input their answer

[X] The selected option populates into the box above, and if an option is already in the box, it is replaced by the new option

[X] Clicking ‚Äúcheck answer‚Äù submits the answer to be checked for correctness

[X] After clicking ‚Äúcheck answer‚Äù, the user can see which components of a drink they entered correctly and incorrectly by having the box for that answer change visually

[X] Clicking on the new drink button shows a new drink and clears the input boxes

## Stretch Features
[] The user can type in their response in each box instead of having to click on the option, and typed inputs are properly validated
